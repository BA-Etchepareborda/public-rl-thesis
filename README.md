## 🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this research is to develop a robust navigation stack that integrates **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)** with **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** to ensure safe trajectories in environments with unpredictable moving obstacles.

### Key Features:
- **Environment:** High-fidelity simulation using NVIDIA Isaac Lab.
- **Agent:** Deep RL policy (PPO) optimized for safety constraints.
- **Integration:** Seamless communication via **ROS 2 Humble**.
- **Sensors:** 2D/3D LiDAR fusion and RGB-D camera perception.
